# Sky-Stacker

Sky Stacker is a game written in Verilog and programmed onto an FPGA.
Items continuously fall from the top of the screen, and are worth varying amount of points.
The goal of the game is to accumulate as many points as possible before time runs out.
The timer and point total are displayed on the FPGA's onboard 7-segment displays.
The buttons and switches control the game.
